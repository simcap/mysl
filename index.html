  <h2>Capitalism &amp; Entrepreneurship</h2>

  <h2>Capitalism &amp; Internet</h2>
  <p>Capitalism has ported the model of inequality to the internet. The accumulation of capital is the accumulation of user data which has to be centralized. Internet makes distribution easy by design. It makes it easy to share data that are distributed. But capitalism prevents the internet to reach its original purpose: to be distributed and resilient by simply interconnecting sub networks and redundant resources.</p>
  <p>It is no surprise to find out that the prevalent business model on the internet is to centralized exchanges. 
  Let us take the exemple of Facebook. The original idea is to interconnect people 
  git cand makes them share data easily.</p>
  <p>The idea start with a few lines of code and rapidly funds are needed to buy infrastructure
  so that we can welcome more people. At this point the system does not have to be centralized.
  The issue starts when people who are going to invest in the idea wants a sound business model so that
  they see growth and constant return on their periodic investments.</p>
  <p>One of the obvious way to make profit is to capitalize on privatizing user data. In order to
  privatize user data all the user exchanges have to be controlled and go through central
  points of collection. A distributed model would not be able to sustain such a business model.
  Capitalism tends to bring monopole and accumulation of capital to the internet as it does to the non internet world.</p>

  <h2>Spoof movies</h2>
  <p>Spoof movies are a derived product of a society that consumes a lot of movies. A spoof movie is a comedy made of a mashup of other movies. Watching a spoof movie scene the audience laugh twice as much if they identified
  from which movie the scene is coming from. As a product the spoof movie is therefore more efficient
  if the audience has seen all the movies that the spoof is referring to.
  A generic product - such as a spoof movie - is not on the market if a preliminary study has not shown that
  the product has a potential return on investment.  Seing the success and relative quantity of spoof movies those conducted market studies must show that the audience is receptive to movies made up of a mashup of other movies.
  In other terms a majority of the audience has clearly seen most movies referenced in spoof movies.

  <h2>Software</h2>
  <h3>Pair programming</h3>
  <p>Wherever we need to reach a decision on something that has a global impact we take this decision
  with more than one person: such is the assembly, the senat, the jury for the verdict on a trial.
  Pair programming serves the same purpose.</p>


  <h2>Technology</h2>
  The car is an advanced piece of technology. It is worth noticing though that you cannot get stuck
  in traffic when you are on foot.
